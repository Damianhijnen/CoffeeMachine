summary: "<p>What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? Two cups. Press\
  \ a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voil&agrave;, a burst of raw energy is\
  \ in your hands. But first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project,\
  \ you will work on a coffee machine simulator. This machine uses regular ingredients\
  \ &mdash; coffee, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will\

  \ And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.</p><br/><br/>Learn\
